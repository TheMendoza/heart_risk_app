## Cardiac Triage Questionnaire App/Automation

Records patient triage assessment upon arrival/registration, helping prioritize care based on the severity of their conditions.

### Introduction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. However, the initial screening process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for healthcare providers. Our Automated Heart Risk Assessment Tool addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly, AI-driven solution that can be integrated into clinical workflows.

<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br>The Cardiac Triage Questionnaire app is designed to streamline the patient intake process by assessing and recording the severity of cardiac symptoms upon arrival or registration. Using a simple Python-based interface, this tool provides a quick and efficient way to prioritize patient care based on their triage scores.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the app is to facilitate effective and timely triage decisions in a healthcare setting. By evaluating patient responses to a series of pre-defined questions, the app calculates a total score that indicates the urgency of the patient's condition.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring and Action</strong><li>Total Score Greater Than 4: The app triggers a triage call to ensure immediate attention for potentially severe conditions.</li><li>Total Score Less Than 4: Patients with lower scores are directed to proceed with standard booking procedures, allowing healthcare providers to  manage their workload effectively.</li></p>

<p>The app can be seamlessly embedded into an HTML website or integrated into existing applications, providing a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and enhancing patient management efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><li>Efficiency: Quickly assesses and records patient conditions to aid in prioritizing care.</li><li>Integration: Can be embedded into websites or other applications for easy access and use.</li><li>Scoring System: Provides actionable outcomes based on a calculated score, facilitating prompt and appropriate care responses.</li></p>
